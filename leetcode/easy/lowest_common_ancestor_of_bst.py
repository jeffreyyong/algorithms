Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) for two given
nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor is defined between
two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T hathat has both v and w as descendatns (where
we allow a node to be descerndant of itself)"

For example, the lowest common ancestor( LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Another example is LCA
of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendent ofcitself according to the LCA
definition.
