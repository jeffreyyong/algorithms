Task description

A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.

A permutation is a sequence containing each element from 1 to N once, and only once.

For example, array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 2

is a permutation, but array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3

is not a permutation, because value 2 is missing.

The goal is to check whether array A is a permutation.

Write a function:

    class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

that, given a zero-indexed array A, returns 1 if array A is a permutation and 0 if it is not.

For example, given array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 2

the function should return 1.

Given array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3

the function should return 0.

Assume that:

        N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].

Complexity:

        expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
        expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).


Execution:

Mark elements as seen in a boolean array. Elements seen twice or out of bounds of the size indicate that the list is no permutation. The check if the boolean array only contains true elements is not required. This solution only works with permutations starting from 1.

def solution(A):
    seen = [False] * len(A)

    for value in A:
        if 0 <= value > len(A):
            return 0
        if seen[value-1] == True:
            return 0
        seen[value-1] = True

    return 1
